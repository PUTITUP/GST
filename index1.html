  <h2>KNOW ALL ABOUT GST</h2>
  <p>Of late, there was a lot of hype about GST, the latest taxation reform introduced by Indian government to amend the prevaling tax system.</p>

  <p>This brought a sense of commotion and uncertanity among the common public, simply because the concept and the benefits were not understood. In the segment we are going to discuss each every aspect related to GST in an easy to undersatand and
    relatable language.</p>
  <h2>FIRST OF ALL, LET US TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE TERM GST</h2>
  <p>Going by the name; GST-Goods and Services Tax, is a single unified form of tax, which levies upon all goods and services. All trades and people involved in give and take of goods and services, will now pay GST, instead of getting entangled in
    many different forms of taxes, levied in different businesses in different forms. GST replaced many direct and indirect taxes, which were earlier in practice, and thus simplified the taxation procedures to a great deal. The prominent view behind
    the introuction of GST was to intregrate the tax procedure, not only at state level, but at central level and bring in the economics betterment of the nation.</p>
  <p>Thus GST is a actually a smart taxation system.</p>
  <p>In the previous tax system, there were a large number of taxes collected by central and state government on manufacturing, sales and consumption of goods and services (we will discuss these in details in capter-3) With GST in force, ll such
    taxes will be replaced and there will be 2 major taxes prevailing; 1 GST and 2. Income tax.</p>
  <p>It is huge positive step taken by Indian government to improve on taxation system and toconvert Indian into one common market by merging thr taxes at Central and State level. The reform is going to make life easier and simpler for all, and will
    bring in a lot of transprancey in business dealing, which is definetly going to kill corruption to a large extent.</p>
  <p>Now, let us take a look at the journey as to how GST was implanted in India.</p>
  <p>The introduction of GST was implanted in India.</p>
  <p>In the budget speech for Financial Year 2006-2007 , held on 1st April, 2006, a proposal for GST was initiated, to simply the taxation, which was already prevalent in many foreign nation.</p>
  <p>Following that, the Empowered Committe of State Finance Minister initiated the task on building a roadmap of Gst in first trimester of 2007, In NOV,2007, first report to the committee was submited by the team working on it.</p>
  <p>Committe fine-tuned and finalised this first report in 2008 and submitted it by the name: " A MODEL AND ROADMAP FOR GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IN INDIA"</p>
  <p>Empowerd committe released the first paper discussion on the report in Nov.2009.</p>
  <p>In 2010, then Finance Minister: SH. Pranav Mukherjee, mentioned in his speech to introduce GST from April 2011, which eventually did not happen.</p>
  <p>Thereafter, a full report on GST was submitted to parliament by Standing Committee, in August 2013. The Empowered Committee rejected the proposel in the same year November, as petroleum products were not included in the report.</p>
  <p>In the session held in December 2014,122nd Amendment Bill of Constitution was passed in Lok Sabha to levy GST.</p>
  <p>Finally, on 3rd August, 2016, the bill was accepted and passed by Rajya Sabha, and it was said that GST will come in force from 1st JUly, 2017.</p>
  <p>And thus,Good and Services Tax Bill (GST), known to be as 122nd Amendment Bill, saw the light of day on 1st July, 2017.</p>
  <p>In the current scenario, where industrialization is the need of the hour and pacing swiftly, GST is undoubtedly a big step in endorsing the economics development of the country. It comes along with the comittement of financial development and
    benifits. </p>
<h2>WHAT ARE THE BROADER BENIFITS OF GST?</h2>
<p>Prime Minister SH. Narendra Modi had a vision with regard to GST. He saw it as the most needed reform for the nation, bringing following growth and benifits.</p>
<p>Prime Minister SH. Narendra Modi had a vision with regard to GST. He saw it as the most needed reform for the nation, bringing following growth and benifits.</p>
<p>From a regular consumer or laymen point of view, the most prominent advantage of GST is almost 30% reduction of overall tax burden on goods and services, which we all were paying earlier, on buying the products or using any services. Thus, the prices will fall.</p>
<p>Entry tax and state have been removed, which ensures free movement of goods from one state to another, making the availiblity of goods easy. This also enhances the importing and exporting powers of manufacturers and treaders.</p>
<p>Also, the multiple taxes, which were prevailing earlier, required a lot of paper work, in various tax segments.</p>
<p>All business had to engage themselves in huge paper piling while filing their tax returns. Now that GST is a unified form of tax, the paper work will be reduced considerably.</p>
<p>As India is a Fedral Republic, so GST is implanted by Central and State Government.</p>
