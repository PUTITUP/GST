    <h1>WHY WAS THERE A NEED FOR GST IN INDIA-
      AN INTRODUCTION TO GST COUNCIL</h1>

    <p>Before GST, INDIAN Tax System was a giant ballof numerous taxesthat were paid at different stages of business, and were seperately collected by State and Central Government. The tax rates also differed from one sate to another. Hidden taxes on
      exports, and no charge applicable on importing the goods from one state to another were also the instrument to fraud and forgery. This led to an enatngled tax structure, with a lot of discrepancies taking place and tax corruption getting
      elevated.</p>
    <p>GST, instead, unified the tax structure and consequently the entire nation. Now, the consolidated tax collected will be divided among Central and State Government, which is an easier way to provied services and goods across the nation, without
      any additional taxes imposed on them.
    </p>
    <p>Additional taxes imposed on goods and services at different stages meant a substanial increase in cost that the end consumer was paying. The manufacturers and traders increased the costs to even out their tax burden. Also, the complex tax
      structure was insufficient, with a lot of loopholes being created in the entangled web. That is the reason, a consolidated and unified text structure was needed to eliminate all these. GST Taxation will add alot of value at each stage of
      business and trading. Thus, the economics growth is sure to be seen, in the coming phase of GST. India can now be identified as one national market with a unified and simplified tax structure, that too at a resonable tax rate.
    </p>
    <p>GST is going to bring in a lot of transparency in the entire taxation system of the country, Consumer and businessman will thus know the amount of taxes they are paying to government for manufaturing, sale and purchase of goods and services.
    </p>

    <h3>Now let us take a quick look at some of major benifits of GST:
    </h3>

    <p> <span>SIMPLIFIED TAX STRUCTRE: </span>As explained earlier, GST is a unified tax entity which elimates a lot of taxes that were paid earlier at different business, like VAT, Excise, Service Tax ets, which you must have seen on the bills that
      you recieved for your purchase. Now,GST is single tax, which is levied on any good or services being sold or purchased. This is the biggest benifit of this tax system. All the confusion is eliminated. For businesses, accounting complexities
      will reduce resultiong in less paperwoork, which will save both time and money. GST will increase economic GDP by 2%-2.5%.
    </p>

    <p><span>A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN TAX REVENUES:</span> When the tax system is simplified, people will not run away from paying the taxes and willingly come forward to contribute through a single tax entity, GST. This will create a ood revenue
      depsite for government, to be used in further development and betterment of the nation
    </p>
    <p> <span>REDUCED PRICES OF GOODS AND SERVICES:</span> When the taxes are reduced by removing various direct and indirect taxes, the manufaturers , traders and services providers will automatically make their offering available on lower prices
      for end consumers. Also, lower the prices, heigher the demand; which clearly means a substantial boost to economy. Businesses and companies will benifits from this, as they will be producing more and selling more.
    </p>
    <p><span>A FIRM BOOST TO EXPORT INDUSTRY:</span> With the introduction of GST, India will rise as a competitive market with a fair pricing. This will encourage more and more foreign players to enter Indian market, thus, giving a good boost to
      export and trading.
    </p>
    <p>GST will take away cascading effect of various taxes that are charged on sale/ production/ purchase taking off the burden from all the tax payers and end consumers.
    </p>
    <p> <span>{But, all this reform making, decision making and implantaion was not easy and will not be easy in future course. To have structure in place and to make the processes smooth, a ruiling or decision making body was needed. Thus, GST
        Coucil came in place.
      </span> </p>

    <h3>WHAT IS GST COUNCIL AND ITS FUNCTION
    </h3>

    <p>The key decision making body which is making all yhe important decision regarding GST, its structure the norms, regulation, enforcement and implementaion is called GST Council. It is this council that is deciding the tax rates, tex exemption,
      the due dates of obtaining GST forms, and deadlines of filing GST. This is council is also responsible for making decision regarding special rates and provisions for various states. The major responsibility of GST council is to ensure a uniform
      tax system and tax rates for good and services across the country.
    </p>
    <h3>HOW IS GST COUNCIL STRUCTURED </h3>
    <p>As we discussed earlier in chapter-1, Constitutional Amendement Bill 122 was introduced in the parliament to implant GST in the entire nation. This bill was passed by Rajya Sabha on 3rd August, 2016 and Lok Sabha on 08th August,2016. After
      being approved and accepted by 15 stated Hon'ble President Sh, Pranab Mukhherjee gave his assent to "The Constition (One Hundred And First Amendment) Act 2016" on 8th of September, 2016. After this assent, on 16th of September 2016, Government
      of India issued notification about bringing a council in existence, which would be solely responsible for making all decisions related to GST.
    </p>

    <p>Since then GST council and been notified bringing into existence the constutional body to decide issues relating to GST. Article 279(1) of the amended Indian Constution staes that the GST Council must be to be constituted bt the President
      within 60 days of the commencement of the article 279A. This article also states that GST Council will be a joint forum for the Centre and States.
